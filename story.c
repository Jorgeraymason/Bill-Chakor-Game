        "News Anchor: Breaking news, politician Newt Manson climbs the ranks in the lodge of Roxford.",

        "He was recently promoted to Supreme Zealot for his honorable deeds and admirable progress in his political campaign ‘Exterminate the black germ’ to mitigate the fatal illness known as the black germ.",

        "Another Last night, there was also a terrible tragedy of the shooting of Lashawnya Williams, as well as her affiliate, Zoey Pines.",

        "The two run a gardening business called Young Hoes'' where they do freelance landscaping.",

        "Manson reports to have claims of Mrs. Williams planting a bomb, in an attempt to conceal blatant racism.",

        "Williams was wounded but not killed",

        "Jason: Well, there is it. The autopsy of LaShawnya Williams. One gunshot wound to the shoulder. Died from profuse bleeding. This happen overnight.",

        "Bill: Trying to exterminate the Black Germ? That’s just Reptilian Authority. Well that’s unfortunate. Wonder what she was doing anyways to even get shot on creed property. They must have been committing a serious crime.",

        "Jason: According to the overview, she was quote caught in the midst of the act while she planted the bombs. She was shot in an attempt to bomb the lodge.",

        "Bill: That’s tragic, truly. Defying the creed was a major mistake on their end.",

        "Bill: Idiots! They should have never done that. I'ld laugh in their face",

        "Bill: Eh. Couldn't have been me.",

        "Jason: Why would you say that? That's terrible!",

        "Jason: Who knows? It may have been. Opposing such a powerful organization is just down right stupid!",

        "Jason: I'll say! Same here.",

        "Bill: (Laughing) Actually though! Man, I feel bad for the person trying to defend them. Good thing I’m not taking their case! They have to be guilty. So anyways, lay me with my first assignment! Who am I defaming this time? Some nobody again, isn’t it? I’m used to these cases, we took so many like them back in Nunya Biznes.",

        "Jason: What are you talking about? Did you not hear the news article? That’s who you’re making fun of? He’s guilty, clear as day, there is no trial.",

        "Bill: (shocked, nervous) WHAT. You mean to tell me I have to defame Newt Manson? He’s creed though?. THIS IS SUCH AN INCREASE IN DIFFICULTY, WHAT THE HELL. I’m only used to nobodys? I go from taking on local foes now to big time names? I’m not ready for this?",

        "Jason: Keep in mind that you chose to work for our Firm. When you signed with us, you agreed that you will take any case assigned to you. It’s also the reason why we gave you the benefits that we did. Now the woman in the holding office will give you more details on the man you’re roasting. She awaits you in there.",

        "Bill(internal monologue): I WANTED a shot at becoming a creed member. Welp, looks like that’s out the window.",

        "Jason: You alright? You look uneasy?",

        "Bill: Understood Boss. give me the overview, I will take the case.",

        "Jason: I just did, about a minute ago.",

        "Bill: Oh.. uh right. On my way now!",

        "Bill then walks into the holding office where he then sees his first so called client",

        "Bill: (Nervously, extending his hand) Um- Hello there. I’ll be your representative. The name is Bill. Bill Chakor. So Tell me, what happened.",

        "Zoey: (scorning, refusing to shake his hand) Likewise pal. Zoey Pines. Did you not just listen to the news? You just talked about the overview with your boss? And my name was mentioned in the news. You look scared shitless.",

        "Bill(inner monolouge): I don’t know, maybe because I have to go against an IMPORTANT FIGURE. Someone who actually has a REPUTATION. On top of that, it’s my literal FIRST TIME.",

        "Bill: Uh No! Nah, nope, not at all. I’m good. I’m straight as a line segment. So you what is it you want me to do?",

        "Zoey: So listen lawyer dude, you go out on the stand and make fun of the guy HARD CORE. got it? Embarrass him for what he did to me. For what he did to us. Me and LaShawnya.",

        "Bill (internal monologue): I’m not even a lawyer! I just make…fun of people. But thanks for the title I guess?",

        "Jason: What the girl said, Bill. What do you say?",

        "Bill: I already said, Im up to the task! I’ll do it, I already agreed!",

        "Jason and Zoey: Good.",

        "Later that day, he prepares for court. Bill is wearing a regular blue shirt and plain black sweats.Here is the modified text with a ",

        "Jason: So uh… no suit? Just normal clothing?",

        "Zoey: Yeah, I thought lawyers had fancy suits? What happened to that? Unprofessional, bro.",

        "Bill (internal monologue): Says the one with earrings, thigh-high jean shorts, and sandals!",

        "Bill: Well, my check from Tensen hasn't come in yet, so I can't really get one.",

        "Jason: Anyways, Bill, let's go over some things first. I don't need to teach you anything, considering you already have training, but now you're dealing with bigger foes. These cases will now cost you or build your reputation. So keep that in mind. People of different classes are looking at you… well, potentially, so good luck!",

        "Bill: So it'll cost me the opinion of others if I lose? Got it.",

        "Jason: Yup. Spot on exactly. This isn't like the easy stuff we did in Nunya Bizness, with just local names and people.",

        "Bill (internal monologue): Thanks for the last-minute heads up. Who would have guessed?",

        "Bill then proceeds to court. Bill is standing in front of the so-called legendary, Newt Manson, who is standing there pridefully with his embellished Creed uniform, decorated all over with pins, cords, medals, and shoulder marks.",

        "Judge: Court is now in session. Mr. Manson, are you ready?",

        "Newt: Ready as day, Your Honor!",

        "Judge: Mr. Chakor, are you ready?",

        "Bill: Y-yes, Your Honor. I'm prepared.",

        "Judge: Let court commence. Mr. Manson, your opening statement?",

        "Newt: Well, Your Honor, you see, I just think this whole news article is complete folly, but you know what? I'll admit, I DID shoot the girl. So what of it?",

        "Bill (internal monologue): I bet she was doing something wrong too! I'm so sorry, Newt. I'm so sorry I have to do this to you.",

        "Judge: Opening statement, Chakor?",

        "Bill: Umm… Not really. Except I was told to just defame the man before me.",

        "Newt: Defame me? This is who they sent to do it? Send a professional, not an amateur. I've had far better roasters in the past. You're facing the Creed, you know.",

        "Judge: What he said. This won't be a cinch, Mr. Chakor. Good luck!",

        "Bill (internal monologue): Welp, this is it, I'm doomed. I failed you, Kris. I failed you, Pandora.",

        "Bill: Alright then. Let's talk about you, Newt Manson.",

        "Newt: An interesting subject! What about me?",

        "Bill: Shooting a woman because she's black, eh?",

        "Newt: More than that. She was a trespasser.",

        "Bill: I… doubt that. It's bigotry in plain sight. That's what it is.",

        "Newt: I really don't care what your take on the matter is. You're literally wearing sweatpants and a blue shirt to COURT.",

        "Bill (to himself, sweating): Low blow, dude, low blow… I wish I had the wealth for a dope suit like that.",

        "Newt: Something wrong, lower class?",

        "Bill (internal monologue): I grew up in the middle class! I just don't have the clothes… yet.",

        "Bill: You think you're above everyone else, huh? You're high on arrogance, Manson.",

        "Newt: Am I? Or rational thought?",

        "Bill: Newt, you're so ARROGANT, you climbed on top of the highest point of elevation on Lexington and thought you were above everyone else.",

        "Newt: What? That makes no sense?",

        "Bill: Exactly my point! Let's also talk about your campaign: 'Exterminate the black germ.' You hate black folks that much, huh?",

        "Newt: Of course! They are NOT the same. That ghetto woman deserved to get shot!",

        "Bill: Well then why would you hire her in the first place?",

        "Newt: To exterminate the black germ, one by one!",

        "Bill: If that's the case, then why didn't you just go on a mass genocide? You had the authority to do it? Now I really have to make fun of you!",

        "Newt: Well, you see, it would get me in trouble with my superiors. So I needed a more subtle scheme.",

        "Bill: Thanks for admitting, now you're in even deeper water. Newt, you're the type of guy to cut the grass with scissors instead of using a lawnmower.",

        "Newt: You're the type of guy to come to a serious eventdressed unprofessionally.",

        "Bill (internal monologue): I didn't have anything else! I just moved here.",

        "Bill: I only had this to wear… We all don't have a sweet uniform like yours…",

        "Zoey: Dude, seriously? You're complementing this racist? His uniform looks STUPID. Why don't you make fun of him for that too? I wouldn't say anything nice about him.",

        "Bill: It's just hard. I want a nice suit so bad... The Creed uniform is so dope. They're so organized, fancy, clean, and wealthy… I just...",

        "Zoey: Snap out of it! Who cares about all of that? Look at the people that run the organization! 'Exterminate the black germ'? That's what flies in the eyes of the Creed? Then I wouldn't look up to them at all.",

        "Bill: You make some fair points. I'll try to find more flaws.",

        "Zoey: Let me say something: Hey Manson, you know what Bill said about you? Your uniform looks like a cult robe.",

        "Bill: I didn’t say that! Lies!",

        "Newt: Bill, I have a proposition for you. If you stop embarrassing yourself right now, I’ll invite you to a ballot. Deal? It takes a great deal to defame a creed member.",

        "Bill (to himself, sweating): Zoey, Kris, and Pandora, I’m placing FULL FAITH in you guys with this decision.",

        "Bill: Uh. I’m sorry, I’ll pass. Kris told me not to join the creed. He was Tensen, so I will be too. Also, uh, I kind of don’t know you all too well.",

        "Newt: Fool. Your loss. The nice lodges? The sweet pins and cords? Fancy titles? You really don’t want it?",

        "Bill: S-shut it! It’s time I go complete ham on you, Newt Manson!",

        "Newt: Not if I make fun of you first! You work for an organization named TenSen. What does that even mean?",

        "Bill: You’re under an organization called the Rationalist Creed. What is rational about trying to kill off the black race? I thought you guys were elite and prestigious?",

        "Newt: We are! Elder Grafton taught us well. You know what? Oh yeah? How about that friend of yours? You call yourself a good person, yet you hang out with a temperamental and brash idiot?",

        "Bill (internal monologue): She is?! I barely know the girl. He’s probably right! I met her on the spot… Damn it. I have to take back what I said!",

        "Judge: This is a good time to pause. Let’s take a 10-minute recess.",

        "Bill then runs over to Newt Manson, who is over in the lounge, drinking tea.",

        "Bill: H-Hey, you know everything I just said was all jokes, right? I don’t mean anything by it, man! So what do you say? We can work something out after this, right? I just had to say it in front of my boss and all.",

        "Newt: Hphmm. Shallow as ever. You're a real fickle, you know that? Once you blaspheme the creed, you’re permanently under charge. Norvius Seclorum Semper Invictia, Bill. Better come up with some good insults while you’re still on break.",

        "Newt then walks off, then Bill is just standing alone, distraught.",

        "Bill (internal monologue): Welp, my chances are officially S C R E W E D. I tried. That was my ticket out of the middle-lower class… How else will I get my reputation up now? Whatever, after all, the guy is a bigot…",

        "The two men head back to court, the court reconvenes.",

        "Judge: Are the two men ready to continue? Your reputation is on the line here. Keep that in mind.",

        "Bill: I’m ready, your honor.",

        "Newt: I’m ready as well.",

        "Bill: Let’s get back to business. So let me get right. So I’m talking to the man that thought he was too good for the rules, yet was dumb enough to forget that you’re in an authoritarian organization?",

        "Newt: Let’s get this right, you’re all about making people look bad, yet you choose to come to court in a normal shirt? Let’s start with your physical appearance.",

        "Bill: Y-you know what? How about we talk about yours. You wear these cult-like robes with medals on them? Why? What do those medals even represent?",

        "Newt: Years of destroying puny reputations, like yours.",

        "Bill (To himself): I can’t lie, that was sharp.",

        "Newt: This trial should be adjourned already, judge. I’m too good for this, really!",

        "Zoey: Ugh, Bill, for the love of god. This man isn’t hard to joke on!",

        "Bill: You’re right, Newt. I’ll adjourn it really fast. Let’s get rid of your reputation!",

        "Newt: You’re boring me already. Let’s see what you have this time.",

        "Bill: Shooting people for fun huh? Not all of us have that privilege. You’re so entitled, you think sleep is a waste of time.",

        "Newt: What? I- Im not that impatient.",

        "Bill: You’re so arrogant, you refuse to go through a door unless someone else opens it for you",

        "Newt: Hush. I walked here on my own.",

        "Bill: You’re not only lacking humility, but lacking intellect. Let’s talk about your flawed plan! Framing a girl for planting bombs?",

        "Newt: It’s because she HAD bombs. She had bombs!",

        "Bill: No she didn’t. Answer me this newt. Why would someone who in your eyes is so dumb, want to bomb the creed lodge if they don’t even have the intellect to understand your supreme philosophy?",

        "Zoey: Snickers Okay I gotta admit I don’t understand politics but that was good.",

        "Newt: You know what! Those infected with the black germ may be dumb, but you’re worse! You’re worse! Lower class should go!",

        "Bill: The only thing leaving is your reputation! You tried walking on water with cold shoes and thought you were gonna form ice",

        "Newt: You went to the thrift store to get those clothes!",

        "Bill: I didn’t…. I had these already… I may have cheap clothes for sure. But at least I didn’t try going to the clothing store to get ‘software’",

        "Newt: I don’t have to go to the store! I get all of my clothes fine tailored!",

        "Bill: You thought you had to give someone money to pay attention",

        "Newt: Not how it works! You GIVE someone your time.",

        "Bill: I bet you tired giving someone a piece of a clock when someone asked for some of your time",

        "Newt: I QUIT. This man is too annoying. My ego will NEVER be destroyed by someone like yourself. My fellow zealots will talk bad of you. I SWEAR. I can’t stand someone who can’t take me seriously.",

        "Newt Manson walks out and slams the door. The guy couldn’t stand the embarrassment. He took it too seriously.",

        "Judge: Newt…? Manson…? I didn’t think he had that frail of an ego. Well the opponent forfeited. Mr. Chakor, this looks good on you. Court is adjourned.",

        "Bill: That fast? I thought I’d be here for…hours.",

        "Bill then meets with Zoey, who is now there outside of the courtroom, laughing.",

        "Zoey: Nice work dude! That was funny. Way to make someone look bad. Told you that dude was a total manchild! That guy has the ego of a kid. That’s why I said OVERLOOK status.",

        "Bill: Well thanks. I was just impressed with him. I saw making friends with him as a way to get that sweet uniform, reside in the nice lodges, eat fancy dinners, and all that other good stuff. It looked cool!",

        "Zoey: Oh you could have taken it, I just wanted you to roast him. He didn’t tell you? I have a bad record bro, but we weren’t guilty.",

        "Bill(internal monologue): S E R I O U S L Y. I just rejected an opportunity to join the creed to join a rowdy woman!? This can’t be real…",

        "Bill: Great. So uh… what do we do now?",

        "Zoey: CELEBRATE. Duh? First, you gotta meet Lashawnya. She a cool lady. We’re going to the casino tomorrow, but FIRST, come back to the hotel tomorrow morning. She’ll be there with me, getting breakfast. I stay at the Roxford Hotel.",

        "Bill: Awesome. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow?" ,

        "Zoey: You bet lawyer dude. We gotta chat more. Cya." ,

        "Zoey then walks off, after which Bill then leaves to go debrief with Jason about his first case/roast over at Tensen Law Firm." ,

        "Jason: Made fun of Manson like a pro. I’m proud of you." ,

        "Bill: Thanks Jason. Always helpful. Just carrying on what Kris wants." ,

        "Jason: I bet. But listen I need to tell you something. Manson was a piece of cake. Notice how he didn’t really insult you back and just keep taking your insults literally? Well not all opponents will be like that. Some will have sharp tongues, some will be unfazed, some will be hard to break. Just know not everyone will surrender that easily. He was just weak. Anyways, that’s all from me." ,

        "Bill: That’s all you had to tell me? That’s it? When will I get to see my family again?" ,

        "Jason: Don’t worry, you will once break comes around. Look for now, you can go visit whoever you know around here, but your post is in roxford, got it? Just make friends here or something? I can’t hangout, I’m busy." ,

        "Bill: It’s just odd, I don’t know anyone here, and to be upfront, I don’t want to hang out with that other girl, Zoey. She just…lacks etiquette. She invited me to go to the casino, so I said I’d go, out of respect for the girl. I just felt bad." ,

        "Jason: The 7 Spades Casino? Ran by Ricchi Ippatsu? THAT’S PERFECT. That man has a criminal record. If you can just go there and confirm our suspicions, you can put him on the spot and gain reputation. He’s been a point of suspect for a while, gang affiliations and a rigged casino." ,

        "Bill: Will do. I’ll keep in touch, Jason." ,

        "That night Bill leaves Tensen Law Firm, and heads back to the hotel and gets some rest for the night." ,

        "The next day, Bill goes to the roxford hotel lobby to meet up with Zoey, who invited him to hangout. He arrives in the lobby and looks to see that there are chicken sliders being served to hotel guests for free. There is a sign saying 5 Sliders per guest limiting the servings per person. Bill steps in the line to wait for his food. He waits peacefully and most orders go smoothly until suddenly some conflict breaks out in line. There she was, Zoey Pines, arguing with the vendor serving sliders." ,

        "Food Vendor: Hey! Can you count? That’s 6 not 5. Read the sign lady." ,

        "Zoey: (reads the sign and rebuttals)  I did. That’s 5 on my plate. I don’t know where you see a sixth. Don’t you have eyes?" ,

        "Food Vendor: There were three on both sides of the plate, adding up to six. Did you go to elementary school?" ,

        "Zoey: plops on the slides into her mouth and eats it There. Now there’s 5. Are you happy?" ,

        "Food Vendor: (angrily) Get out of my line! You’re holding up the line!" ,

        "Immediately, a young black woman grabs her by the arm and storms off." ,

        "LaShawnya: Cmon’ girl, we don’t got time to waste about some sliders." ,

        "Bill: (To himself)  Newt wasn’t kidding…. This girl is a cut up." ,

        "Bill finally gets his sliders and goes to sit down with the two girls. They left the hotel and are now outside at an outdoor table eating their sliders discussing some important business. LaShawnya Williams, who runs a gardening business called Young Hoes, sits across the table from her fierce friend, Zoey Pines." ,

        "LaShawnya: Zoey! You can’t be going around causing a ruckus everywhere you go?! We got a business to run. A reputation to uphold!" ,

        "Zoey: (Scoffingly) That guy was delusional. I clearly only had 6 on my plate, not 5. I don’t know what his deal was." ,

        "LaShawnya: That’s a waste of energy to be pickin’ a fight with everyone who don’t agree with you.You’re lucky he even let you walk off with any food on your plate at all!" ,

        "Zoey: He’s lucky I didn’t put my hands on him. Or we wouldn’t have walked off at all." ,

        "LaShawnya: Why you gotta be so hard-headed? Just chill out sis." ,

        "Bill(interrupting): Souh, is this where you wanted to meet?",

        "Zoey: There you are, lawyer dude! Sit down. Oh and meet LaShawnya.",

        "Lashanwya: Hey Bill, how you doin’?",

        "Bill: woah now this woman… this is who Newt tried to shoot? How cruel of him…. Now I’m glad I didn’t join!",

        "Bill: Hey! how is goin’ sista?",

        "LaShawnya: Sista? Uh I ain’t never seen you before. This yo friend, Zoe?",

        "Zoey: You could say that. He roasted the hell out of Newt Manson for that setup at the lodge!",

        "Bill: Oh yeah, that was me.",

        "LaShawnya: Him? He doesn't even look like a lawyer? Does he have a high reputation or something?",

        "Zoey: Sure he has on ragged clothes, but it doesn’t detract from his skill. Dude has wit for days.",

        "Bill: Hey I have the money! I just…haven’t gone to the store yet.",

        "Zoey: If you’re broke you can just say that",

        "Bill (internal monologue): Maybe Newt SHOULD have shot you instead!",

        "Bill: So uh, what did you guys need to tell me?",

        "Zoey: Nothing dude. We’re just inviting you to hangout. We wanted to know if you wanted to go to the 7 Spades casino.",

        "Bill: Casino? Gambling isn’t really my thing.",

        "Zoey: Well you don’t have to play, you can just watch. Just come anyway.",

        "Bill (internal monologue): Well actually, the 7 spades casino means…Uncle Ricchi…..",

        "Zoey: So? What do you say?",

        "Bill: I’ll go. There’s someone I wanna see there.",

        "Zoey: You know someone there or something?"
